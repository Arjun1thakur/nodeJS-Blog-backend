Some of these removals are due to clear policy violations while others are wrapped in a shroud of mystery. Last March, around one-third of shareholders at Apple’s annual meeting backed a resolution that called on the firm to be more transparent about the apps it removes.',
    content2:'The root of the concern is Apple’s apparent willingness to appease foreign governments. For example, at the request of Beijing, apps for publications like the New York Times, encrypted messaging apps WhatsApp and Signal, and numerous social media apps are banned from the App Store in China. Apple has published a biannual ‘Transparency Report’ since 2018 (although it missed H2 2021 and published no reports in 2022). The reports provide information on how many requests it’s received from governments, and the type, but does not provide any reasoning.'
